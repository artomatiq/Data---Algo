1. Linked List


Common Use Cases:

Dynamic Data Storage: When you need a dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink easily (e.g., when inserting or deleting elements frequently).
Implementing Other Data Structures: Linked lists are often used to implement stacks, queues, and hash tables.
Browser History: Each visited page is a node linked to the previous and next pages.
Undo/Redo Operations: Each change in a document can be a node, allowing traversal back and forth.

Typical Scenarios:

Frequent Insertions/Deletions: Linked lists excel when you need to frequently insert or delete elements, especially in the middle of the list, without shifting other elements (as with arrays).
Low Memory Requirement: They are efficient when you don't know the final size of the collection beforehand.

Interview Tip:

Time Complexity: Mention that searching for an element is O(n), but inserting/deleting nodes (when the pointer is known) is O(1).
Edge Cases: Be prepared to handle scenarios like an empty list, deleting the head or tail, and searching for non-existent elements.




Potential Problems...

Reverse a Linked List: Given the head of a linked list, reverse it in place.
Detect a Cycle: Check if a linked list contains a cycle (using the "Floyd's Cycle Detection" or two-pointer technique).
Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists: Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
Remove Duplicates: Remove duplicate elements from a sorted linked list.
Find the Middle Element: Use the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle node of the linked list.




2. Stack


Common Use Cases:

Function Call Stack: Used to manage function calls and local variables in programming languages.
Undo/Redo Functionality: In text editors or applications where you can revert to a previous state.
Expression Evaluation: Used in compilers or calculators to evaluate mathematical expressions (e.g., converting infix to postfix notation).
Depth-First Search (DFS): Used in algorithms to explore nodes/vertices.

Typical Scenarios:

LIFO Requirement: When the most recent element needs to be accessed first (e.g., the last opened tab in a browser).
Recursive Operations: When using recursion explicitly or implicitly, a stack is often involved.

Interview Tip:

Time Complexity: Push and pop operations are O(1).
Use Cases: Emphasize scenarios where LIFO order is needed. Be ready to implement a stack using both arrays and linked lists.



Potential problems...

Balanced Parentheses: Check if a string of parentheses (()[]{}) is balanced using a stack.
Evaluate Postfix Expression: Use a stack to evaluate mathematical expressions given in postfix notation (e.g., "5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -" ).
Next Greater Element: Given an array, find the next greater element for each element using a stack.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Implement undo and redo features in text editors using a stack.
Valid Palindrome (String Reversal): Check if a string is a palindrome by pushing characters onto a stack and then popping to compare.




3. Queue


Common Use Cases:

Task Scheduling: Managing tasks in order (e.g., print jobs, CPU task scheduling).
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Used in graph traversal algorithms.
Producer-Consumer Problem: Used in concurrency to manage tasks between producers and consumers.
Messaging Systems: Queues are used in systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka to process messages in the order they arrive.

Typical Scenarios:

FIFO Requirement: When elements must be processed in the order they arrive (e.g., handling customer support tickets).
Rate Limiting/Throttling: When controlling the flow of requests in an application.

Interview Tip:

Time Complexity: Enqueue and dequeue operations are O(1).
Edge Cases: Be ready to handle scenarios like dequeuing from an empty queue and implementing a circular queue.



Potential Problems...

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Use a queue to traverse nodes in a graph or tree level by level.
Implement a Cache (LRU Cache): Use a queue (often with a linked list) to track the least recently used elements.
Task Scheduling: Use a queue to manage tasks in a first-in, first-out order (e.g., processing print jobs).
Sliding Window Maximum: Use a deque (double-ended queue) to find the maximum in each sliding window of size k in an array.
Rotten Oranges Problem: Use a queue to track the spread of rot among adjacent oranges (grid-based problem).









General Tips for Technical Interviews:

Clarify the Problem: Before choosing a data structure, ask questions to clarify requirements (e.g., is order important? Will there be frequent insertions or deletions?).
Understand Complexity: Be ready to explain why you chose a particular data structure and discuss its time and space complexity.
Know Edge Cases: Handle scenarios like an empty list, stack underflow (popping from an empty stack), or dequeuing from an empty queue.

Practice Common Problems:

For linked lists: Problems like reversing a linked list, detecting cycles, and merging two sorted linked lists.
For stacks: Problems like balancing parentheses, evaluating postfix expressions, and implementing a min stack.
For queues: Problems like implementing a queue using stacks, finding the first non-repeating character, and implementing a circular queue.
